# Getting And Cleaning Data - Week 4

### The purpose of this project is to demonstrate - ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

### Contains R code, a code book and the a tidy data set.

## Files
### CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations performed to clean up the data.

### R code run_analysis.R contains the code that does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### FinalTidyData is the output after step 5
